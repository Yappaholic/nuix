#+description: All in one CLI for Nix/NixOS users

This is my attempt to unify the nix/NixOS command line programs in spirit of Guix cli. It is WIP and highly experimental, so definitely don't use it for production.

** Current roadmap ([0%] done :3)
- [ ] Map every command to its respected command in nix [0%]
  - [ ] System
  - [ ] Home-manager
  - [ ] Garbage collector
  - [ ] Search
  - [ ] Package management
  - [ ] Channel management
  - [ ] Shell
  - [ ] Prefetch/Download
- [ ] Add checks for NixOS users
- [ ] Add ~--man~ and ~--help~ options for each command
- [ ] Add ~nh~ integration
